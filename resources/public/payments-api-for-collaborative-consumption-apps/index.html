You want to be able to process their payments</li><li>sellers - people who sell stuff. They should be able to get earned money out of the markeplace on their personal/business accounts</li></ul><p>Online markeplace usually works within following steps:</p><ol><li>process payment from buyer</li><li>cut procent from transaction as service fee</li><li>put money on virtual account of the seller</li><li>seller transfers money to his personal account (using e.x. bank wire transfer)<p></li></ol>Collaborative consumption apps (think <a href='http://airbnb.com'>AirBnB</a>) have just one additional step:</p><ol><li>process payment from buyer</li><li>cut procent from transaction as service fee</li><li>hold money on virtual escrow account</li><li>put money on virtual account of the seller</li><li>seller transfers money to his personal account (using e.x. bank wire transfer)</li></ol><p>The only difference is that usually in crowdfunding apps sellers will not get money immediately(on AirBnB owner of the place will get money after you move in, but money itself will be locked on your account immediately after reservation).</p><p></p><h2>US vs Europe</h2><p>Turns our that if your company is based in US there are already few options, but <a href='https://www.balancedpayments.com/'>Balanced</a> seems to be the best one. These guys are really amazing. They are building an open company. Read about <a href='http://www.fastcolabs.com/3008944/open-company/why-i-made-my-payments-startup-an-open-company'>it</a>.</p><p>But if your company is based in Europe options are much more limited.</p><p>After some investigation for us we found new promising solution called <a href='http://www.mangopay.com/'>Mangopay</a>.</p><h2>Mangopay</h2><p>Mangopay is product of <a href='http://leetchi.com'>Leetchi.com</a> and they claim to be<blockquote><p>the European leading service for group payments  </p></blockquote>In general there are two typical apps that you can built on top of their payments:</p><ul><li>marketplaces and collaborative consumption platforms</li><li>crowdfunding platforms</li></ul><p>And that was exactly what we needed.</p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>We still not using Mangopay API in production, but so far it looks that it fits our needs. API itself is well designed and <a href='http://www.mangopay.com/api-references/'>documentation</a> is full and has good examples.</p><p>We even created <a href='http://os.hashobject.com/mangopay/'>Clojure library</a> for it.</p><aside class="post-meta small-12 columns"><img class="author-avatar" src="/images/anton-avatar.png"><div class="meta-info"><div><span class="meta-label">Written by</span><a class="author-name" href="http://hashobject.com/team/anton">Anton Podviaznikov</a></div><div><span class="meta-label">Published: </span><span>Jul 19, 2013</span></div><div><span class="meta-label">Modified: </span><span>Jul 18, 2013</span></div><div><span class="meta-label">Published in: </span><span>Nicaragua, Leon</span></div></div></aside></div><footer class="post-discussion small-12 columns"><p class="discussion-link">Discussion for this post available on <a href="https://github.com/hashobject/blog.hashobject.com/issues/4">GitHub</a>.</p></footer></div><footer class="row"><div class="content"><p class="licence">Except as otherwise noted, the content of this site is licensed
