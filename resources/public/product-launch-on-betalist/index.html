Our idea was to make launch only using one source. We choosed to launch our site using service called <a href='http://betali.st'>Beta List</a>. Now we try very short analyze what happened.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>We decided to launch simple signup page (single HTML page with <a href='http://mailchimp.com/'>MailChimp</a> subscription form) because we wanted to start collecting information about users interested in our new product. For us choosing Beta List for initial launch was obvious solution since we are using it ourselves (highly recommend subsription for their daily emails). Beta List is site that will send to subscribers email with new companies/products/startups that are in beta period and looking for the users, early adopters. Basically Beta List subscribers are people already interested in trying new app and solutions. Anyone can submit their product to Beta List and after some review it will arrive as part of newsletter to big amount of potential users.</p><h2>Goal of the post</h2><p>Before submitting our product to Beta List we didn't know what to expect:</p><ul><li>when our submission will be accepted?</li><li>how many people will visit our site?</li><li>how many people will subscribe?</li><li>how many tweets and other social intereactions we will get?</li></ul><p>Basically it was black box for us. That's why we want to share about everything we find out.</p><p><h2>Stats</h2></p><p>We submitted our site on July 16, 2013 (you can do the same for free on this <a href='http://betali.st/submit'>page</a>, your page will look similar to <a href='http://betali.st/startups/communist'>ours</a>). After submission we got message that typical time for review(and approval in most cases) is 5 weeks(we were shocked!) and that it was possible to speedup process payng some money. We were very surprised when it was published to the site after just 5(!) days on July 21 (it was Sunday).</p><p>The cool thing about Beta List is that after new entry published on site a lot of automatic twits will be send (because around 250 Beta List users set up automatic broadcasting ot new entry to Twitter).</p><p>So we instantly got a lot of automatic tweets that got some traction on <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23communi.st'>Twitter</a>. On Monday (July 22) our entry was in the Beta List's daily email.</p><p>Here's our results from Google Analytics:</p><p><img src="/images/product-launch-on-betalist-fig-1.png" alt="Google Analtics results" /></p><p>You can see that during two days we got more than 200 visits. It'snot a huge number, but remeber that lot of this users are much more likely to signup for your site, because they already read about you on Beta List page of from newsletter. So conversion rate should be pretty high. For us conversion is number of users who signed up using our MailChimp form.</p><p>In 2 weeks after launching exclusively on Beta List we got 60 signups, while total number of unique visitors is 435 (from July 21 till August 4).</p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>We think that we made very interesting experiment of launching site just on Beta List. We got very interesting statistics that may help you when you'll plan your launch. We also recommend reading these posts on why and how to prelaunch your product:</p><ul><li>http://www.bogdannedelcu.com/why-you-should-pre-launch-your-startup-idea.html</li><li>https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/63fa3e5603b</li></ul><footer class="post-footer"><p class="discussion-link">Discussion for this post available on <a href="https://github.com/hashobject/blog.hashobject.com/issues/6">GitHub</a>.</p></footer></article></div></div><footer class="row"><div class="content"><p class="licence">Except as otherwise noted, the content of this site is licensed
