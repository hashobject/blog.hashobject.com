## Intro

If you are starting to work on the new web project there is huge amount of tools and services
available that may speed up your development, improve code quality, simplify maintenance and
deployment etc.

Let's split such tools by group for future reference. Most of the tools are agnostic to your environment. Some of them may be not. I used a lot of them in the Node.js and Clojure projects.
