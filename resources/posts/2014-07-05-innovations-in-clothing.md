## Intro

I felt for some time now that nothing new is happening in the fashion/clothing industry.
We still wear conceptually same clothes as people decades ago. The quality usually is not good for
mass market brands. Most of the companies are focused on consumption these days. Probably few brands care
about quality, design, innovation, ecology, sustainability, health of consumers.
Not many companies are using technology to succeed.


## Hope

But there is hope. I was keeping an eye on the companies that are doing something cool.
Here is my list of companies to keep an eye on:

  * [Atheist](http://www.atheistberlin.com/atheist) - they launched on reddit and kickstarter.
  It's just a great story how can you start international brand nowadays. And they are a good company
  with *correct* motivations.

  * [ACRONYM](http://www.acrnm.com/) - another interesting company from Germany. Checkout their videos.
  They basically do a lot of cool clothes that can be transformed. It's quite a shame that they are so pricey though.

  * [UpCouture](http://upcouture.com/en/content/14-concept) - French company that designed affordable
  good looking T-Shirts that helps you to improve your posture.

  * [Betabrand](http://www.betabrand.com/) - online community from San Francisco that helps to design and manufacture new products.

  * [Nasty Gal](http://www.nastygal.com/) - great story of making huge brand in under the decade. Read Sophia Amoruso story in the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasty_Gal). I find it pretty impressive and
  hopefully motivating for new people wanting to contribute to this industry.

  * [Pistol Lake](http://www.pistollake.com/) - amazing communication with customers, attention to details in everything from clothing to personalized emails, post cards etc;
  clever use of social media with Instagram campaigns. I do like a lot that friends of founders are models:
  you can see real normal people wearing Pistol Lake clothes.

  * [IguanEye](http://en.iguaneye.com/) - shoes company that uses combinations of ancient Indians technique with modern technology.

  * [Outlier](http://outlier.cc/) - pretty young company from New York that are trying to make fashionable and durable clothing for men that can be used during casual and also active events.


## Conclusion

Feels like our clothes will look differently in few years.
Mass customization will replace mass production. People should be able uniquely express themselves through clothes using customization. There should be Tumblr for this industry.
It will attract tons of creative people, they will create "themes" available for everyone.
Tumblr allowed creatives to have their own space on the Internet with unique
design and without knowledge of web technologies, html, javascript.
Someone should create product that will do the same for clothing. I can definitely see
online marketplaces where you would be able to buy "themes" for your underwear from people
around the world.


I hope to see smaller startups/brands disrupting huge corporations. Crodwfunding will play a big role in this change. Someone will solve problem with production/manufacturing of new clothes.
It would be much easier and cheaper to start own fashion brands.
And new brands would be able to innovate on design, technology, quality, usability etc.
