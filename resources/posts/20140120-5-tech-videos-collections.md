## Intro

I would like to make compilation of cool tech videos resources I discovered during 2013.


## SICP

This is a [gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY&list=PL8FE88AA54363BC46) that I
discovered during [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com). I never heard about
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
book before fall 2013. I was able to work just through beginning of the book and videos lectures
but that was enough to open my eyes on some fundamentals of programming.


## Bret Victor

I watched my first video from [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/) two years ago. In 2013 he made more talks.
I highly recommend watching [all of them](https://vimeo.com/worrydream/videos). That will inspire you,
provoke some thoughts on programming, computer science, education.


## Foundation

[Kevin Rose](Dependencies Status) over years produced loads of great interviews with enterpreneurs, programmers on his [Foundation](http://foundation.bz/) series. At the moment (January 20, 2014) it has
35 interviews with the people like Elon Musk, Ben Horowitz, Jack Dorsey, Ev Williams, Phil Libin, Dave Morin,
Kevin Systrom etc. Some of the interviews reveal fascinating biographical facts and stories from these
successful people.


## Small empires

[Alexis Ohanian](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian) makes cool series called [Small empires](http://www.theverge.com/video/small-empires). I just recently discovered those videos and going to watch all of them.


## Shots of Awe

[Jason Silva](https://twitter.com/JasonSilva)'s work was a mindblowing discovery for me. Futurism, philosophy, life questions wrapped in short, high-quality (picture, sound) videos. Absolutely lowed it and can watch each video several times. The density of information is so high in his works! Definitely recommend
[Shots of Awe](http://testtube.com/shotsofawe).

## Conclusion

That was list of 5 great resources with great videos. Hope you'll enjoy them as much as I did.
