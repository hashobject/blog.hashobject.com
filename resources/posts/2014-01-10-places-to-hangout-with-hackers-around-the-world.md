## Intro

Everytime I visit new city I want to know places where all hackers/startupers/bright minds hangout.
That is why I decided to create (and update over time) the list of places I personally visited
over years. This list includes coworking spaces, cafes etc.


## Mountain View, USA

In the heart of Silicon Valley [Red Rock](http://redrockcoffee.org/) cafe is the place to go. Most visitors there will be people talking about technologies, startups. You will meet hacker, investors there.


## Berlin, Germany

[St. Oberholz](http://www.sanktoberholz.de/?page_id=27&lang=en) is an amazing place in Berlin. It's great cafe with proper food and coffee. It has two stores and very working-friendly. It's place for hackathons, meetups and just meeting point in Berlin tech scene.

Another good option that I like in Berlin is [mobilsuite](http://www2.mobilesuite.de/en/berlin-prenzlauer-berg) coworking space. Some good meetups are using this great space.

## Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

There is [amazing group](http://www.meetup.com/DevinRio/) of technology enthusiasts in Rio.
Guys from group meet every week and work together for one day. They are super passionate about open source
and different cool technologies.
[Henrique Bastos](https://twitter.com/henriquebastos) is the guy to meet there. He will tell you a lot about technology in Brazil.

## Kyiv, Ukraine

If you are in capital of Ukraine just go to coworking place [Chasopys](http://coworking.chasopys.ua/en/). It's has good location,
lot of rooms and bunch of cool residents. You definitely can meet lot of interesting people who are in technology.


## Conclusion

I'm going to update this list with time. If you have some good recommendations send me
[Pull request](https://github.com/hashobject/blog.hashobject.com) and I'll try to visit place and add it to my list.
