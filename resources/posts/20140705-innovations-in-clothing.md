## Intro



## Problems




## Conclusion

Can we imagine what will happen if we just "forget" all the history? Wars between the nations, slavery, genocides etc.  How we will treat every new person we meet? Will his nationality, origin, skin color matter to us?

Does history protect us from repeating mistakes of the past or does it influence our attitude to each other?
