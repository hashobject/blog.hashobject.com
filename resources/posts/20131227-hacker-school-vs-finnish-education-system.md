## Intro

I'm a big fun of Finnish education system. I like to read about it and discuss with people passionate
about education.
Also I just spent incredible 12 weeks as student in the fall batch of Hacker School. Hacker School is
unqiue place, I'm even more excited about it now than before applying. It was that good.

Now let's try to find some similarities between education in Finland and Hacker School.


## Minimal structure

You have very minimal structure to education both in Finland and in Hacker School. It helps to focus
on things students want to study themself, things they are passionate about. Students motivated to learn
are the biggest advantage of any educational system.

## No grades

Why do wee need grades? It's just refreshing when you can spent time leaning what you like instead of
thinking how to get the highest grade.

## Collaborative environment

In Finland they split classes in groups. In each group students work together and try to help each other.
Same happens at Hacker School. Students self-organize themself into smaller groups by interests:
SICP group, Machine Learning group, JavaScript learning group, Hardware group, Nand2Tetris group etc.
Anyone can join as many group as he want (or work by herself/himself).


## Teachers

Teaching is very respectfull occupation in Finland. Only person with master degree can teach others.
It's hard to become teacher. You have 10 people per place contests. Salaries are really good.
This drives the best people to teach others. Best people can prepare even better next generation of students.

Very similar approach is used in Hacker School. Facilitators are previous Hacker Schoolers. And they
are really good. They are good example for students.

## Respect

Both Finland schools and Hacker School try to achieve environment of creativity, investigation, exploration and
learning. In modern schools you cann feel respect between students. Everyone should respect willigness to learn.


## Social responsibility and help

Finland is the social responsible country. They try to support people that need support.
Hacker School tries to bring more women to industry. They work hard and spend lot of time
to get grants from big companies for women students who need financial support.

## Conslusion

Personally I found lot of similarities between super modern approach to education used in Finland
and Hacker School.

Finland students are leaders in world-wide contests. I would argue that really top-class people passionate
about computer science and/or software engineering and/or startups go through Hacker School.

## Disclosure

I've never been to Finnland so my understanding of it's education system based on online articles,
blogs and talks with friends.
