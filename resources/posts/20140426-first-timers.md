## Intro

For the last 2.5 years together with [Maryna](http://twitter.com/m_aleksandrova) I'm  am trying
[digital nomad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad) lifestyle. We are travelling around the world while
working as designer and developer. We visited handful of countries during that period and I noticed one interesting thing.
While travelling you always trying something new and doing something that you never did before.
Here is my list of "first timers".

## Sailing

First time I tried sailing on July, 2012 in Croatia. It was on the small island in the [Kornati National Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kornati). It was actually also my first time ever that I lived on island where I spent 3 days learning how to sail from the locals.

## New wonder of the world

First time I saw new wonder of the world was in the Rio de Janeiro. It was December of 2012. It was our first time in the Southern Hemisphere. We obviously visited [Cristo Redentor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)) statue.

## Pyramid

My first pyramid happened to be not in Egypt but in Mexico. [Teotihuacan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan) is really impressive site very close to Mexico City.
I was lucky enough to see [Chichen Itza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza) later but
Teotihuacan remains the most beautiful construction I ever saw. I was there in January 2013.

## Scuba diving and other things

We lived in th [Playa del Carmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playa_del_Carmen) for the 3 months during 2013.
It is beautiful small town south from the Cancun on the Caribbean sea.

I had chance to do a lot of things for the first time in my life. Like scuba diving

and riding quadricicle

and visiting [cenotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote) and doing [snorkeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorkeling) near the island of [Cozumel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozumel).

## Volcano

I'm from flatlands of Ukraine so visiting active volcano in Guatemala was unforgettable. I attended
[Pacaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacaya) volcano very close to the Guatemala City. You can see micro erruptions every 10 minutes. We've been in Guatemala for 5 weeks in the May, 2013.

## Skyscrapper

Panama City was a huge surpise for me. I didn't know anything about city and the country beside canal.
I was extremely surpised when I saw skyline of the city from the plain. When we went back for a trip there we stayed in the top floor of skyscrapper (40th floor). My first stay ever in skyscrapper actually. August 2013.

## Equator

Ecuador is one of the most beautiful countries for me. We lived in Quito and were hiking on the altitude
of 4000 meters. Again it's really high comparing to Ukrainian flatlands. We took chance to make few photos on
equator visiting [Mitad del Mundo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Mitad_del_Mundo) - Middle of the World. August 2013.

## Kayaking

I tried kayaking first time ever while travelling in Macedonia. [Canyon Matka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matka_Canyon) is just outside of Skopje and the nature is
astonishing. April, 2014.

## Other

There are a lot of things like this that happened to me first time somewhere outside of my home country.

E.x. first time we rent a car was in Nicaragua, first time I played tennis was in Montenegro, my first robbery
was in Rio de Janeiro, first ever visit to Asia happened in January 2014 when I arrived to Instabul.

## Conclusion

After being digital nomad for the past 2.5 years I must say that I never regret that decision. It's eye-openning,
it's inspiring, it's actually not expensive, it's not difficult but it is also not for everyone. I'm going to write about it in few upcoming blog posts. I wanted to explore just one side of such lifestyle in this post.
Travelling allowed me to do and try a lot of new things in very short period of time.
